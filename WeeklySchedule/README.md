# Weekly Scheduling Application
### A project by Evan Wrench

The project I will design this term is a weekly planner that helps you budget your time. You will be able to add
and remove events on the planner in addition to seeing what times you are free this week. Users will also be able to 
let the application know when a task is completed, and the program will tell them if they are on schedule. I want
to make the application as user-friendly as possible and add functionality to make it more interactive. I personally
want to work on this project, since procrastination is a big problem for me, and having a schedule to help me plan
my week would help me work more efficiently. In addition, I find most scheduling applications difficult to use, so
I want to design one that can easily be interacted with.

This application will be useful for:
- Anyone who needs to budget a busy life for example students who also work a job
- Anyone with multiple ongoing projects they need to budget time for 
- Anyone that has an issue with procrastination
- Anyone who just wants to make their life a little more organised

## Phase 4: Task 3
If I had more time, I would have liked to change a few things about my program:
- Instead of having the user input an integer for the day, letting them select the day from a list of Radio Buttons
- Having PlannerTable be associated with WeeklyPlanner instead of WeeklyScheduleApp so that I would only have to call methods that involve the table once in WeeklyScheduleApp
- Letting users select a function(add, remove, etc) and then click a cell they wanted to apply that function to instead of entering a day and time
