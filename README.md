# WeeklySchedule
## Description
A weekly schedule where you can add, remove or mark events as complete. This program uses JUnit tests, Swing components for the GUI and the JSON library for
saving and loading functionality. The goal of this program was to make a scheduler that was intuitive to use and useful for everyday life. As this was an
academic project, there was a limited amount of time to complete it, but some changes I would have made are:
- Implementing the ability to change the time of an event (rather than having to remove it, then add it at a different time)
- Making the program more visually appealing
- Allow the user to see a list of all events they have finished
